This is an exercise project.

It is intended as a small application which goal is to calculate the shortest path from the Start position (Xstart = 0, Ystart = 4) to the End position (Xend = 9, Yend = 4) while adding random non-passable blocks to the map. On level 1 there are 0 blocks on the map, on level 2 there is 1 block, on level 3 there are 2 blocks, etc. These blocks are placed in random order on the map at the start of each level. In other words, after every successful run, a map will be recreated with new non-passable blocks. Each block element will block only one x/y coordinate field.
If no path can be found, the game is over.

Technologies used:
- HTML, CSS, Styled Components
- JavaScript, React
